# Security Update & Improvements

## üîí API Key Security Fix

### Issue
- Last.fm API key was potentially exposed in repository
- Environment variables not properly secured

### Fixes Applied
1. **Removed exposed API key file** - Deleted the file containing the actual API key
2. **Updated environment template** - Enhanced `env.template` with proper documentation
3. **Improved error handling** - Added better error handling for API calls
4. **Enhanced .gitignore** - Ensured all environment files are properly ignored

### Next Steps
1. Create a `.env` file using `env.template` as reference
2. Add your actual API keys to the `.env` file
3. **IMPORTANT**: Consider rotating your Last.fm API key if it was exposed
4. Never commit `.env` files to git

## üé• YouTube Video Background Improvements

### Enhancements
- **Smoother autoplay** - Added `origin` parameter for better compatibility
- **Improved loading** - Enhanced transition timing and performance optimizations
- **Better error handling** - Added proper error handling for video loading
- **Performance optimizations** - Added `will-change` and `backface-visibility` properties

### Technical Details
- Added `origin=${window.location.origin}` parameter for better autoplay
- Enhanced `allow` attribute with `web-share` permission
- Improved video loading with better transition timing
- Added performance optimizations for smoother playback

## ‚ú® Enhanced Particle System

### New Features
- **More particles** - Increased from 12 to 20 particles
- **Variable sizes** - Particles now have random sizes (2-5px)
- **Variable speeds** - Each particle has unique animation speed
- **More colors** - Expanded color palette with 18 vibrant colors
- **Enhanced glow effects** - Added multiple shadow layers and glow animation
- **Improved animations** - Added horizontal movement and better scaling

### Color Palette
- Red tones: `#ff6b6b`, `#ff3838`, `#ff6348`, `#ff4757`
- Blue tones: `#4ecdc4`, `#45b7d1`, `#54a0ff`, `#1e90ff`

- Orange/Yellow tones: `#feca57`, `#ff9f43`, `#ffa502`
- Teal tones: `#00d2d3`
- Additional vibrant colors for variety

### Animation Improvements
- Particles now move both vertically and horizontally
- Enhanced glow animation with pulsing effects
- Better opacity transitions
- Improved scaling effects
- Added `mix-blend-mode: screen` for better visual integration

## üöÄ Performance Optimizations

### Video Background
- Added `will-change: opacity` for better performance
- Added `backface-visibility: hidden` for smoother transitions
- Enhanced loading states and error handling

### Particles
- Optimized animation performance with better timing
- Added `overflow: hidden` to particle container
- Improved blend modes for better visual effects

## üì± Mobile Optimizations

All improvements are mobile-responsive and work well on all device sizes.

## üîß How to Use

1. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```bash
   cp env.template .env
   # Edit .env with your actual API keys
   ```

2. **Run the security cleanup script** (if needed):
   ```bash
   .\cleanup-security.ps1
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Use environment templates for documentation
- Rotate API keys if they were exposed
- Use proper error handling for API calls
- Validate environment variables before use
